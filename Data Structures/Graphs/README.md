# Graphs

## Challenge
Implement a Graph represented as an adjacency list.

## Approach & Efficiency
We are not doing any traversals so we don't have bigO yet. It will depend on the traversal.

## API
GetNeighbors: Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
AddEdge: Adds an edge between the two vertices
GetNodes: Returns a list of the graphs vertices
Size: Returns the number of vertices in a graph

## Credit
I worked with Kendra Ellis on this implementation
