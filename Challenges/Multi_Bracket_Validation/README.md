# Multi Bracket Validation

## Challenge
Write a function that takes a string as its only argument, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O:
Time: O(n) - potentially have to go through full length of string
Space: O(n) - creating a stack and pushing elements to it
