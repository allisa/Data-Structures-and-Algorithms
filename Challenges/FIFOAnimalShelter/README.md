# FIFo Animal Shelter

# Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

# Approach & Efficiency
Big O:
Enqueue:
Time: O(1) - only animal(cat/dog) is being added to animal shelter
Space O(1) - no other animals are made

Dequeue:
Time: O(n) - worst case is having to dequeue and requeue to get the desired animal
Space: O(1) - no additional memory allocated
